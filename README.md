✈️ British Airways — Data Analytics Virtual Experience (Forage)

This project is part of the British Airways Data Analytics Virtual Internship on Forage.
It simulates real-world airline analytics work — from web scraping and data cleaning to exploratory analysis and customer insight generation.

The goal was to turn raw customer reviews and booking data into clear, actionable business recommendations.

🔍 Approach & Methodology
1️⃣ Web Scraping (Skytrax Airline Reviews)

I built a Python scraper to extract:

Reviewer name & location

Travel details (route, travel class, seat type, etc.)

Ratings & recommendation status

Full review text

These were stored in a structured dataset for further analysis.

2️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preparation

Steps included:

handling missing/invalid values

normalizing column names

converting rating values to numeric

engineering useful features for analysis

3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key analyses performed:

⭐ Rating distributions across travel classes

👍 vs 👎 Recommended vs Not Recommended trends

🧳 Frequent complaint themes

🔍 Word frequency & review text exploration

✈️ Comparison of service aspects (comfort, food, staff, etc.)

Charts and summaries helped uncover meaningful patterns in customer perception.

📈 Insights (Highlights)

Service-related issues often have a stronger negative impact on reviews than delays alone.

Premium cabin customers emphasize comfort and food quality more than price.

Verified reviews are more critical and honest than unverified ones.

Certain routes consistently show lower satisfaction, suggesting operational issues.

These insights could guide improvements in staff training, route prioritization, and service quality.

🚀 What I Gained

✔ Collecting real-world datasets
✔ Cleaning messy data and structuring it correctly
✔ Storytelling with visual analytics
✔ Bridging technical findings to business strategy

🔮 Future Enhancements

Sentiment classification model for review text

Dynamic scraping for continuously updated datasets

Interactive dashboards in Power BI, Tableau, or Plotly
